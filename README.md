# Learning Next.js

This repository contains my learning journey and experiments with **Next.js**, a powerful React framework for building fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a React framework developed by **Vercel** that enables functionality such as:
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- API Routes
- Image Optimization
- File-based Routing
- Built-in TypeScript support

Itâ€™s designed to help developers build **full-stack applications** quickly, with better performance and SEO compared to traditional SPA (Single Page Application) methods.
